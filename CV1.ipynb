    "he use of Kernels - also known as convolution matrices or masks - is invaluable to image processing. Techniques such as blurring, edge detection, and sharpening all rely on kernels - small matrices of numbers - to be applied across an image in order to process the image as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a kernel? In image processing a Kernel is simply a 2-dimensional matrix of numbers. While this matrix can range in dimensions, for simplicity this article will stick to 3x3 dimensional kernels. An example of a kernel is shown below: image.png How does this matrix relate to image processing? An image is just a 2-dimensional matrix of numbers, or pixels. Each pixel is represented by a number - depending upon the image format these numbers can vary: for an 8 bit RGB image each pixel has a red, green, and blue component with a value ranging from 0 to 255. A kernel works by operating on these pixel values using straightforward mathematics to construct a new image. Lets take the above kernel and do some math: for each pixel, center the kernel over the pixel, multiply the kernel values times the corresponding pixel values, and add the result - this final value is the new value of the current pixel. image-2.png As each pixel is processed, a new image emerges based upon the calculated values. The new image is highly dependent upon the kernel used - each kernel has specific properties depending upon its values. Take the kernel demonstrated above: the mathematics of this matrix results in a value that is the average of all pixels in a 3x3 pixel grid. In short - each pixel is the average of its neighbors - this results in a blurred image. "

    "Stride is the number of pixels shifts over the input matrix. When the stride is 1 then we move the filters to 1 pixel at a time. When the stride is 2 then we move the filters to 2 pixels at a time and so on.\n",

    "Stride is a component of convolutional neural networks, or neural networks tuned for the compression of images and video data. Stride is a parameter of the neural network's filter that modifies the amount of movement over the image or video. For example, if a neural network's stride is set to 1, the filter will move one pixel, or unit, at a time. The size of the filter affects the encoded output volume, so stride is often set to a whole integer, rather than a fraction or decimal.\n",

    "How does Stride work? image.png Imagine a convolutional neural network is taking an image and analyzing the content. If the filter size is 3x3 pixels, the contained nine pixels will be converted down to 1 pixel in the output layer. Naturally, as the stride, or movement, is increased, the resulting output will be smaller. Stride is a parameter that works in conjunction with padding, the feature that adds blank, or empty pixels to the frame of the image to allow for a minimized reduction of size in the output layer. Roughly, it is a way of increasing the size of an image, to counteract the fact that stride reduces the size. Padding and stride are the foundational parameters of any convolutional neural network. image-2.png"
